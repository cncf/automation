# CNCF Automation

This repository contains automation tools and scripts used by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and its projects. These tools help streamline various tasks and workflows, making it easier to manage and maintain CNCF projects.

## Overview

The CNCF Automation repository provides various tools that help automate repetitive tasks, standardize workflows, and improve efficiency across CNCF projects. These tools are designed to be reusable and configurable for different project needs.

## Tools and Components
